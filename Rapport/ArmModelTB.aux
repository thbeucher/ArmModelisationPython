Green: subjective utility of hitting the target; red: muscular energy cost; black: global cost versus reward trade-off. The red area denotes infeasible short times; blue: probability to hit the target; orange:reward expectation (subjective reward times probability). A: Sketch of the models in \cite  {shadmehr10} and \cite  {rigoux12}. The subjective utility of hitting the reward decreases over time as one is less interested in gains that will occur in a distant future than at the present time. Hitting is less and less costly in terms of efforts as the movement is performed more slowly. The expected gain, resulting from the sum of the subjective reward and the (negative) cost reaches a maximum for a certain time. When the gain is negative (outside the useful interval), one should not move. B: Sketch of the presented model. In the case of a larger target, the hitting probability is higher for faster movements (solid lines) than for a smaller target (dashed lines). As a result, the maximum of the reward expectation is shifted towards longer time for smaller targets, and the optimum movement time is also longer for smaller targets.}}{3}{figure.1.1}}
