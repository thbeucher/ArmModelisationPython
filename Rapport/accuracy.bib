@article{Bootsma1994,
abstract = {Earlier studies have suggested that the size of an object to be grasped influences the time taken to complete a prehensile movement. However, the use of cylindrical objects in those studies confounded the effects of object size-extent orthogonal to the reach axis-and object width-extent along the reach axis. In separating these effects, the present study demonstrates that movement time is not affected by manipulation of object size, as long as the latter does not approach the maximal object size that can be grasped. Object width, on the other hand, is shown to exert a systematic influence on movement time: Smaller object widths give rise to longer movement times through a lengthening of the deceleration phase of the movement, thus reproducing the effect of target width on the kinematics of aiming movements. As in aiming, movement amplitude also affects the movement time in prehension, influencing primarily the acceleration phase (i.e. peak velocity attained). The effects of object width and movement amplitude were found to combine in a way predicted by Fitts' law, allowing a generalisation of the latter to the transport component in prehensile actions. With respect to the grasp component, both object size and object width are shown to affect peak hand aperture. Increasing object width thus lowers the spatial accuracy demands on the transport component, permitting a faster movement to emerge. At the same time, the hand opens to a larger grip in order to compensate for eventual directional errors that result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

@article{Plamondon1997,
abstract = {This target article presents a critical survey of the scientific literature dealing with the speed/accuracy trade-offs in rapid-aimed movements. It highlights the numerous mathematical and theoretical interpretations that have been proposed in recent decades. Although the variety of points of view reflects the richness of the field and the high degree of interest that such basic phenomena attract in the understanding of human movements, it calls into question the ability of 'many models to explain the basic observations consistently reported in the field. This target article summarizes the kinematic theory of rapid human movements, proposed recently by R. Plamondon (1993b; 1993c; 1995a; 1995b), and analyzes its predictions in the context of speed/accuracy trade-offs. Data from human movement literature are reanalyzed and reinterpreted in the context of the new theory. It is shown that the various aspects of speed/accuracy trade-offs can be taken into account by considering the asymptotic behavior of a large number of coupled linear systems, from which a delta-lognormal law can be derived to describe the velocity profile of an end-effector driven by a neuromuscular synergy. This law not only describes velocity profiles almost perfectly, it also predicts the kinematic properties of simple rapid movements and provides a consistent framework for the analysis of different types of speed/accuracy trade-offs using a quadratic (or power) law that emerges from the model.},
